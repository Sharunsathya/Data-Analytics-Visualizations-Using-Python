# üåç Global Air Quality Analysis Project  

This project focuses on analyzing global air quality trends using AQI (Air Quality Index) data for pollutants such as CO, Ozone, NO‚ÇÇ, and PM2.5. By leveraging **Python** and its data analysis libraries, we were able to clean, process, and visualize the data to uncover meaningful insights about global air quality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used  

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation, cleaning, grouping, and summarization.  
- **Matplotlib**: Used to create detailed visualizations, including histograms.  
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical plots like boxplots to analyze AQI distributions.

## üìÅ Project Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning and Preparation**  

- **Handling Missing Values**:  
  Ensured that missing values in the dataset were addressed to maintain consistency and accuracy.  

- **Standardizing Column Names**:  
  Cleaned up column names by removing tabs, extra spaces, and unnecessary characters.  

- **Continent Mapping**:  
  - Added a `continent` column to map each country to its respective continent.  
  - This enabled regional-level analysis and insights.  

- **Validation**:  
  Checked the dataset for correctness by verifying unique values, data types, and column consistency.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Visualization**  

#### **Boxplots by Continent**  
- **Purpose**: Compare AQI distributions across continents.  
- **Insights**:  
  - **Asia**: Highest median AQI with many outliers indicating severe pollution in specific regions.  
  - **Oceania**: Lowest AQI values, suggesting consistently clean air.  
  - **Europe, North America, and Africa**: Similar AQI ranges but with localized hotspots seen as outliers.  

#### **Histograms for Pollutants**  
- **Purpose**: Visualize frequency distributions for pollutants (CO, Ozone, NO‚ÇÇ, PM2.5).  
- **Insights**:  
  - **PM2.5**: Higher skew toward extreme AQI values, indicating severe air quality issues.  
  - **Ozone**: A more uniform distribution across regions, suggesting fewer extremes.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Top 10 Countries with Highest AQI**  

- **Objective**: Identify countries with the highest median AQI values.  
- **Steps**:  
  - Grouped data by `country_name` and calculated AQI summary statistics (mean, median, min, max) for each pollutant.  
  - Identified the **top 10 countries** with the worst air quality, predominantly in **Asia**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Summary Statistics for Pollutants**  

- **Objective**: Generate detailed AQI statistics for pollutants like CO, Ozone, NO‚ÇÇ, and PM2.5.  
- **Steps**:  
  - Grouped data by `country_name` and calculated key metrics for each pollutant:  
    - **Mean**: Average AQI value.  
    - **Median**: Central AQI value.  
    - **Min/Max**: Range of AQI values.  

- **Outcome**: Highlighted countries and pollutants with extreme values, identifying areas of concern.

## üîç Key Findings  

1. **Asia**:  
   - Highest median AQI and numerous outliers, reflecting regions with extreme pollution levels.  

2. **Oceania**:  
   - Maintains the lowest AQI levels globally, indicating excellent air quality.  

3. **PM2.5**:  
   - The most problematic pollutant, with a high frequency of extreme AQI values.  

4. **Global Trends**:  
   - Europe, North America, and Africa exhibit localized hotspots of pollution.

## üìä Visualizations  

1. **Boxplots by Continent**:  
   - Visual comparison of AQI distributions for each continent.  
2. **Histograms for Pollutants**:  
   - Frequency distributions for CO, Ozone, NO‚ÇÇ, and PM2.5 AQI values.

## üöÄ Next Steps  

1. **Analyze Temporal Trends**:  
   - Explore seasonal and yearly variations in AQI.  

2. **Socioeconomic Correlations**:  
   - Examine relationships between AQI levels and factors like GDP, population, or urbanization.  

3. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Develop models to forecast AQI levels and identify at-risk regions.
