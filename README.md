# üåç **Air Pollution Analysis Project**  

This project is an in-depth analysis of global air quality trends, leveraging AQI (Air Quality Index) data for various pollutants such as CO, Ozone, NO‚ÇÇ, and PM2.5. The primary goal of the project is to clean, process, and visualize the data to uncover insights into air quality disparities across countries and continents.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Libraries Used**  

- **Python**: The programming language used for data analysis and visualization.  
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, manipulation, grouping, and summarization.  
- **Matplotlib**: For creating plots like histograms and setting up visualizations.  
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical visualizations, such as boxplots.

## üìÅ **Project Workflow**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
We ensured the dataset was clean and ready for analysis by performing the following steps:  

- **Handling Missing Values**:  
  - Detected and addressed missing values in the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.  

- **Standardizing Column Names**:  
  - Renamed columns to remove inconsistencies like tabs, spaces, and special characters.  

- **Mapping Countries to Continents**:  
  - Created a mapping dictionary to link each country to its respective continent.  
  - Added a new `continent` column, enabling regional-level analysis of AQI trends.  

- **Data Validation**:  
  - Verified unique values, data types, and column consistency to confirm the dataset's integrity.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization**  
We used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create meaningful visualizations that uncovered patterns in AQI values:  

#### **Boxplots by Continent**  
- **Purpose**: Compare AQI distributions across continents.  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - **Asia**: Highest median AQI and many outliers, showing regions with extreme pollution.  
  - **Oceania**: Lowest AQI levels, indicating overall good air quality.  
  - **Europe, North America, and Africa**: Similar AQI ranges but with localized pollution hotspots, visible as outliers.  

#### **Histograms for Pollutants**  
- **Purpose**: Visualize the frequency distribution of AQI values for pollutants like CO, Ozone, NO‚ÇÇ, and PM2.5.  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - **PM2.5**: Highly skewed toward extreme AQI values, indicating severe air quality challenges in some regions.  
  - **Ozone**: A more balanced distribution, with fewer extreme values compared to PM2.5.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Top 10 Countries Analysis**  
We identified the **top 10 countries** with the highest median AQI values:  

- **Steps**:  
  - Grouped data by `country_name` and calculated summary statistics (mean, median, min, max) for AQI across pollutants.  
  - Ranked countries by their **median AQI**, revealing regions with the worst air quality.  

- **Outcome**:  
  - **Asia dominated the top 10 countries**, reflecting a need for immediate interventions in this region.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Pollutant-Specific Summary Statistics**  
Generated detailed AQI statistics for each pollutant (CO, Ozone, NO‚ÇÇ, PM2.5) across countries:  

- **Steps**:  
  - Used `groupby` to calculate key statistics (mean, median, min, max) for each pollutant.  
  - Highlighted countries with extreme pollutant-specific AQI values.  

- **Outcome**:  
  - Identified specific pollutants driving poor air quality in different regions.

## üîç **Key Findings**  

1. **Asia**:  
   - The region with the highest median AQI and numerous outliers, indicating severe pollution in certain areas.  

2. **Oceania**:  
   - Maintains the lowest AQI levels globally, suggesting excellent air quality overall.  

3. **Global Trends**:  
   - Europe, North America, and Africa exhibit similar AQI ranges, with localized hotspots of pollution.  
   - PM2.5 is the most problematic pollutant, with significant outliers indicating severe air quality issues in certain regions.

## üìä **Visualizations Created**  

1. **Boxplots by Continent**:  
   - Compared AQI distributions for each continent, highlighting disparities and outliers.  

2. **Histograms for Pollutants**:  
   - Showed the frequency distribution of AQI values for CO, Ozone, NO‚ÇÇ, and PM2.5.  

3. **Summary Statistics for Pollutants**:  
   - Provided detailed statistics for each pollutant across all countries.

## üöÄ **Next Steps**  

1. **Temporal Analysis**:  
   - Examine seasonal and yearly trends in AQI values.  

2. **Socioeconomic Correlations**:  
   - Explore relationships between AQI and factors like GDP, population density, and urbanization.  

3. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Build models to predict AQI trends and identify at-risk regions for worsening air quality.
